1. Each player has a key, using which he signs every request to the server
	key must emulate changes on every request (to prevent duplicate calls)
	(optional) key is updated with each new player session
2. All communications inside the server environment must also be protected
	This mainly applies to payment transaction
	Each payment transaction performed through the signed server request
		Each server has his unique key
		Game transaction can be checked against the server, on which game is on
Generic
1. There is a unique id for the game in the system, and it goes from birth, and never changes
